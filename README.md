# Prediction-of-Blood-Lactate-Levels
The general Laboratory Hematology and Chemistry (LHC), while measuring basic biochemical parameters,
helps to precisely identify the source of pathology. An extended LHC that includes the Lactate Dehydrogenase
(LDH) parameter can more accurately specify the source, type, and cause of pathology. LDH is an
oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyzes lactic acid formation during glycolysis. Unlike most catalysts, LDH
does not accumulate in cells but is evenly excreted as it is formed. Laboratory blood tests are informative
primary diagnostic methods that evaluate possible disturbances in organ and body system functions. The aim
of LDH in biochemical blood tests is to determine hematological, cardiac, muscular, and oncological
pathologies. High concentrations of this enzyme are found in the liver and kidney parenchyma, as well as in
muscle and heart tissues, each having its isoenzyme. A small amount of LDH is present in red blood cells.
This paper discusses using machine learning algorithms to predict blood lactate levels in children after cardiac
surgery. Typically, an increase in LDH concentration indicates cellular destruction and organ integrity
violations, whereas low enzyme levels or its absence are observed in the degenerative stages of liver cancer
and cirrhosis.
